## Motivation:

-  UNDP reports Indonesia ranked 111 out of 189 countries in 2019.
- The insular geography of Indonesia and its largely unbalanced geographic distribution of natural resources and population
- There are relative few studies that evaluate the role of spatial effects on the
process of regional convergence.
- Scarce academic literature on human development convergence at the district level in Indonesia. 

  
## Research Question:
  
- Does convergence take place on the convergence process of human development across districts in Indonesia?

- To what extent the role of space affects the convergence on human development across Indonesian regions?

  
## Methods:

- Classical convergence framework (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992)
- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I and LISA)
- Spatial autoregressive models (Spatial Lag and Spatial Error Model)

## Data:

- Human Development Index and its components 2010-2018 at district level

class: middle

## Main Results:

1. **Significant Spatial Autocorrelation** at the district level. 

2. **Regional Convergence** 

  - At district level, convergence is taking place on the growth process of human development and almost all components.

3. **Spatial effects**
  
  - Spatial effects are increasing the speed convergence of human development and its components at the district level.

4. **Policy Implication**

  - Increasing spatially better coordination and cooperation between local governments and authorities in designing development plans.

# (1) Data

Data of human development index and its three dimensions from 514 districts over 2010-2018 period

The health dimension is represented by an indicator of life expectancy.

The education dimension is represented by two indicators: expected years of schooling and mean years of schooling. 

The decent standard of living dimension is represented by per capita expenditure.

All data are derived from National Socio-Economic Survey, conducted by Central Bureau Statistics of Indonesia (BPS-Statistics Indonesia)

# (2) Convergence framework 

**Sigma Convergence**

**Unconditional beta convergence** 

**Speed of convergence and half-life**

class: middle

# Convergence framework (Brief Overview)

## Sigma Convergence

$$\begin{array}{c}
\sigma_{t}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\log \left(y_{i, t}\right)-\overline{\log \left(y_{t}\right)}\right)^{2}} \\
\sigma^{2}=\frac{\sigma_{u}^{2}}{1-e^{-2 \beta}}
\end{array}$$

## Beta Convergence

- The classical unconditional convergence framework of Barro and
Sala-I-Martin (1992),

$$\log \left(\frac{y_{i, t+T}}{y_{i t}}\right)=\gamma-\left(1-e^{-\beta T}\right) \log y_{i t}+\varepsilon_{i}$$
- Based on the speed of convergence (b), a second parameter of interest can
be computed as

$$\text {half-life}=\frac{\log 2}{\beta}$$

# Evolution of Moran's I statistics and standard deviation over 2010-2018 

![](figs/Fig04.png)
Notes: Regional disparities (right Y-axis) are measured based on the standard deviation of the log of each variable. Global spatial autocorrelation (left Y-axis) is measured based on the Moranâ€™s I, which is statistically significant at 5% level for all years.

# (4) Cross-sectional Spatial Convergence model

Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and Spatial Error Model (SEM)

Direct and Indirect Effects

Goodness of Fit Test ( AIC and BIC)

class: middle, center

# Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and Spatial Error Model (SEM)

**Intuition : Interactions among geographical neighbors can affect the speed of convergence
of the entire regional system**

** Two prominent models under this specification : SLM and SEM**

## Spatial Lag Model

$$\ln \left(\frac{y_{i, t+T}}{y_{i t}}\right)=\gamma-\left(1-e^{-\beta T}\right) \log y_{i t}+\rho \mathbf{W} \ln \left(\frac{y_{i, t+T}}{y_{i t}}\right)+\varepsilon_{i}$$
## Spatial Error Model (SEM)

$$\ln \left(\frac{y_{i, t+T}}{y_{i t}}\right)=\gamma-\left(1-e^{-\beta T}\right) \log y_{i t}+(\mathbf{I}-\lambda \mathbf{W})^{-1} \varepsilon_{i}$$

# (5) Concluding Remarks

- **Inequality still matters**. The West-East polarization are still becoming the persistent feature of Indonesia's economic and social development.
- Increasing spatial dependence is associated with decreasing regional disparities
and faster regional convergence
- Spatial effects are accelerating the pace of convergence at the district level.
- Without role of space, faster convergence in education-related variables tend to accelerate the speed of convergence of human development.
- With role of space, only health and economic related variables tend to accelerate the speed of convergence of human development.

# Implications and further research

- Call for better coordination of regional policies at the DISTRICT level.
- Enhance inter-regional connectivity and cooperation. 
- Geography matters! breaking spatial barriers, improving infrastructure and human capabilities required  must be on top of the policy agenda.
- Next extension: spatial panel and dynamic panel models could be implemented to control for unobserved heterogeneity.On the other hand, extension of spatial lag and error model like Spatial Durbin Model and Kelejian and Prucha model (SAC) might be proposed on the upcoming research.
