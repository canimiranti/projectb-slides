## Motivation:

-  UNDP reports Indonesia ranked 111 out of 189 countries in 2019.
- The insular geography of Indonesia and its largely unbalanced geographic distribution of natural resources and population
- There are relative few studies that evaluate the role of spatial effects on the
process of regional convergence.
- Lack of academic literature on human development convergence at the district level in Indonesia. 

  
## Research Question:
  
- Does convergence take place on the growth process of human development across districts in Indonesia?
- To what extent the role of space affects the convergence of human development across Indonesian districts?
- How is the human development convergence as social development compared to that of economic development ?

  
## Methods:

- Convergence framework ( Absolute, Conditional and Distributional Convergence, will be separated on another research project, B2)
- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I and LISA)
- Spatial Panel Models (SAR,SEM,SAC,SDM region-fixed effect)

## Main Results:

1. **Significant Spatial Autocorrelation** at the district level. 

2. **Regional Convergence** 

  - At district level, convergence is taking place on the growth process of human development level and GRDP.

3. **Spatial effects**
  
  - Spatial effects are increasing the speed convergence of human development level and GDP at the district level.

4. **Policy Implication**

  - Increasing spatially better coordination and cooperation between local governments and authorities in designing development plans.

# (1) Data

- Human Development Index and its components 2010-2018 at district level 
- Physical capital (% investment ratio to GDP) 2010-2018 at district level
- Real GDP at 2010 year price 2010-2018 at district level
- Structure of economy ( share of industry and agriculture sector) 2010-2018 at district level
- All data are derived from National Socio-Economic Survey, conducted by Central Bureau Statistics of Indonesia (BPS-Statistics Indonesia)

# (3) Spatial Autocorrelation

Global Spatial Autocorrelation : Moran's I Statistics

Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA)

# Evolution of Moran's I statistics and standard deviation over 2010-2018 

![](figs/Fig04.png)
Notes: Regional disparities (right Y-axis) are measured based on the standard deviation of the log of each variable. Global spatial autocorrelation (left Y-axis) is measured based on the Moranâ€™s I, which is statistically significant at 5% level for all years.

# (5) Concluding Remarks

- **Inequality still matters**. The West-East polarization are still becoming the persistent feature of Indonesia's economic and social development.
- Increasing spatial dependence is associated with decreasing regional disparities
and faster regional convergence.
- Fixed effect models are more appropriate to be applied on this panel data based on Hausman test.
- Spatial effects are accelerating the pace of convergence for both social and economic development, but generating slightly faster speed on economic growth convergence at the district level.
- Human capital factor (s) and sub-national structure of economy are most likely as the major drivers of convergence on social and economic development (HDI and GRDP).
