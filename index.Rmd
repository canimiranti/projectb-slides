## Motivation:

-  UNDP reports Indonesia ranked 111 out of 189 countries in 2019.
- The insular geography of Indonesia and its largely unbalanced geographic distribution of natural resources and population
- There are relative few studies that evaluate the role of spatial effects on the
process of regional convergence.
- Scarce academic literature on human development convergence at the district level in Indonesia. 

  
## Research Question:
  
- Does convergence take place on the convergence process of human development across districts in Indonesia?

- To what extent the role of space affects the convergence on human development across Indonesian regions?

  
## Methods:

- Classical convergence framework (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992)
- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I and LISA)
- Spatial autoregressive models (Spatial Lag and Spatial Error Model)

## Data:

- Human Development Index and its components 2010-2018 at district level

class: middle

## Main Results:

1. **Significant Spatial Autocorrelation** at the district level. 

2. **Regional Convergence** 

  - At district level, convergence is taking place on the growth process of human development and almost all components.

3. **Spatial effects**
  
  - Spatial effects are increasing the speed convergence of human development and its components at the district level.

4. **Policy Implication**

  - Increasing spatially better coordination and cooperation between local governments and authorities in designing development plans.

# (1) Data

- Data of human development index and its three dimensions from 514 districts over 2010-2018 period
- The health dimension is represented by a indicator of life expectancy.
- The education dimension is represented by two indicators: literacy rate and mean years of schooling. 
- The decent standard of living dimension is represented by per-capita expenditure.
- All data are derived from National Socio-Economic Survey, conducted by Central Bureau Statistics of Indonesia (BPS-Statistics Indonesia)

# (2) Convergence framework 

**Sigma Convergence**

**Unconditional beta convergence** 

**Speed of convergence and half-life**

# Convergence framework (Brief Overview)

## Sigma Convergence

$$\begin{array}{c}
\sigma_{t}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\log \left(y_{i, t}\right)-\overline{\log \left(y_{t}\right)}\right)^{2}} \\
\sigma^{2}=\frac{\sigma_{u}^{2}}{1-e^{-2 \beta}}
\end{array}$$

## Beta Convergence

- The classical unconditional convergence framework of Barro and
Sala-I-Martin (1992),

$$\log \left(\frac{y_{i, t+T}}{y_{i t}}\right)=\gamma-\left(1-e^{-\beta T}\right) \log y_{i t}+\varepsilon_{i}$$
- Based on the speed of convergence (b), a second parameter of interest can
be computed as

$$\text {half-life}=\frac{\log 2}{\beta}$$

![](figs/Fig04.png)
Notes: Regional disparities (right axis) are measured based on the standard deviation of the log of each variable. Global spatial autocorrelation (left axis) is measured based on the Moranâ€™s I, which is statistically significant at 5% level for all years.

# Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and Spatial Error Model (SEM)

**Intuition : Interactions among geographical neighbors can affect the speed of convergence
of the entire regional system**

## Spatial Lag Model

$$\ln \left(\frac{y_{i, t+T}}{y_{i t}}\right)=\gamma-\left(1-e^{-\beta T}\right) \log y_{i t}+\rho \mathbf{W} \ln \left(\frac{y_{i, t+T}}{y_{i t}}\right)+\varepsilon_{i}$$
## Spatial Error Model (SEM)

$$\ln \left(\frac{y_{i, t+T}}{y_{i t}}\right)=\gamma-\left(1-e^{-\beta T}\right) \log y_{i t}+(\mathbf{I}-\lambda \mathbf{W})^{-1} \varepsilon_{i}$$

class: middle

# Spatial Error Model (SEM)

$$\ln \left(\frac{y_{i, t+T}}{y_{i t}}\right)=\gamma-\left(1-e^{-\beta T}\right) \log y_{i t}+(\mathbf{I}-\lambda \mathbf{W})^{-1} \varepsilon_{i}$$

# Spatial Convergence Results




# (5) Concluding Remarks

- **Inequality still matters**. The development gap between the East and West of Indonesia is still persistent.
- Spatial effects are accelerating the pace of convergence at the district level.
- Faster convergence in education-related variables tend to accelerate the speed of convergence of human development.
- 

# Implications and further research

- To spatially filter regional income is important in order to avoid misleading interpretations.
- Call for better coordination of regional policies at the cluster level.
- Enhance inter-regional connectivity and cooperation. 
- Geography matters! breaking spatial barriers and the infrastructure and capabilities required for it must be on top of the policy agenda.
- Next extension: spatial panel data models could be implemented to control for unobserved heterogeneity.
